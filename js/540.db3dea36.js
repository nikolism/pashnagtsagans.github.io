After all, Pashinyan is a longtime <a href="https://armenianweekly.com/2020/11/18/armenia-supported-pashinyan-now-pashinyan-must-support-armenia/">Levon Ter-Petrosyan acolyte</a> and is surrounded by figures who have long held the view that Artaskh is a burden and that open borders and friendly relations with Turkey are paramount. If Carmen was simply ill-informed, a quick chat with experienced party members and leadership in Armenia could have quickly remedied that situation. <br><br> While Carmen is singing Nikol Pashinyan&#39;s praises, what does Nikol have to say about the ARF? Soon after the ARF had withdrawn from Pashinyan&#39;s government the Armenian Weekly reported: <blockquote><p class="text-bold text-italic"> Despite recent events, Pashinyan—who recently met with leaders of the ARF in the United States in New York City during his visit to speak at the U.N. General Assembly—expressed an open-mindedness regarding the multifaceted and global nature of the ARF. In a parliamentary news conference, he stated that the party is “multi-layered” and “cannot be judged on all strata by actions of one layer.” </p><small><cite>from the <a href="https://armenianweekly.com/2018/10/03/pashinyan-and-parliament-at-odds-over-early-snap-elections-as-arf-loses-ministerial-footing/">Armenian Weekly.</a></cite></small></blockquote><blockquote><p class="text-bold text-italic"> &quot;Our government is committed to a broadband and effective cooperation with the ARF, since we understand that we do not have a common opinion on many issues, but at the same time there are many issues on which the vectors of our perception coincide at least.&quot; </p><small>Nigol Pashinyan <cite>from the <a href="https://www.primeminister.am/en/press-release/item/2019/01/27/Nikol-Pashinyan-meeting-Dashnaktsutyun/">official government translation.</a></cite></small></blockquote> And so, while the ARF had withdrawn from the Pashinyan government and the ARF Youth were the first <a href="https://armenianweekly.com/2019/12/05/arf-youth-protesters-face-off-with-armenian-police-24-arrested/">to protest</a> the Pashinyan regime, Pashinyan thinks he has some ARF members in his corner. I think I know just who he had in mind. <br><br> Now, let&#39;s see <a href="./carmen_declaration.pdf">what Carmen has to say</a> about the ARF and the ARFDW. <blockquote><p class="text-bold text-italic"> ARFDW was formally incorporated as a Mutual Benefit Corporation, under the laws of the State of California in March 2006 and adopted Bylaws to govern the corporation that same month. </p><p class="text-bold text-italic"> ... Despite its partially similar name and shared ideals, the ARF and ARFDW are entirely separate entities. ... </p><p class="text-bold text-italic"> ...Neither the Bureau nor the ARF has decision-making authority over the ARFDW. </p></blockquote> Now, there may in fact be some legal entity called the ARFDW that filed a set of Bylaws with the State of California that say what Carmen says they do. Such an organization however, is alien and unacceptable to the vast majority of ARF members. <br><br> Carmen goes on to say, <blockquote><p class="text-bold text-italic"> Fearing a full-scale coup of the organization by the ARF Bureau, members of the Central Committee immediately moved to convene an emergency meeting that same day, December 27, 2020. I believed in good faith that an emergency meeting was necessary to avoid an immediate takeover of the ARFDW by the ARF Bureau and its agents. I knew that the ARF Bureau had no right to do what it was attempting to do and I was concerned that the ARF Bureau intended to take the ARFDW’s money and property for itself and it would be impossible to get it back. I understood my obligation as an elected member of the Central Committee was to do my best to prevent the ARF Bureau’s blatant violation of the ARFDW’s Bylaws and to protect the ARFDW’s rights and legal interests to the extent possible. </p><p class="text-bold text-italic"> ... the Central Committee members unanimously voted that the Regional Convention would commence the following day, on December 28, 2020. </p></blockquote> Well, this is clearly problematic. If the ARF, its World Congress, and its elected Bureau do not have &quot;decision-making authority over the ARFDW&quot; then why the concern? Unless of course for some mysterious reason the majority of your organization does in fact believe that the Bureau and World Congress do have authority. <br><br> Another problem with this position is that one would have to find the possibility of the Bureau taking the &quot;ARFDW&#39;s money and property for itself&quot; seriously. Have we seen this happen in the Eastern USA? In Canada? In France? In Lebanon? <br><br> What&#39;s even more interesting is that the ARFDW&#39;s property is held by a corporation called the ACF. So an &quot;immediate takeover&quot; of the ARFDW would only be a threat if the ARFDW controlled the ACF. But in yet another interesting revelation the ACF&#39;s lawyers say that the ACF has no statutory members.
